Okay, I just left the theater after watching Ad Vitam, and wow, my mind is spinning like a carousel backed by the loudest, most colorful band you can imagine. I don't even know where to start. First of all, the theater was FREEZING. I swear, penguins would have come in and made themselves at home. And who designs these seats? Torture devices disguised as chairs, I tell ya. My back still feels like an accordion.

But the movie! Ad Vitam. Totally wild. Picture this: a world where no one ages past 29. Yeah, like, we're all millennials forever. How crazy is that? I'm not sure if it's a dream or a nightmare. There was this scene where they're all in their white suits — seriously, some kind of futuristic Stark Trek meets Gap commercial vibe. And one of the characters, he reminds me of my old boss who always wore socks with sandals, but that's not really here nor there.

> Anyway, the plot. Oh, I'm getting ahead of myself. So, imagine immortality comes with a heavy price. It’s all existential and kind of feels like when you’re holding a bag of popcorn that’s more crumbs than anything else. The philosophy of it all just seeps into your scalp like water into a sponge that sat too long in your grandma’s antique teacup. Characters are grappling with eternal life, and you're left questioning if eternal laundry is part of the deal, too.

Weird part though, there was some glitchy moment where it felt like the film broke the fourth wall while simultaneously waltzing into a bizarre episode of an old Twilight Zone. Was it intentional? Who knows! It's like a cat running across your keyboard and somehow typing perfect haiku. Trippy.

Someone asked me where to watch the movie or maybe it was about downloading it — I can't remember now. Anyway, you could do both, probably. If watching it at home, just make sure your couch isn't an enemy to your spine the way these theater seats are. Get cozy but not too cozy. I don’t think a sweating-in-my-pajamas cozy would do justice.

There was a standout line, something profound like, Is living forever worth dying inside? My brain hiccupped at that. Deep but somehow felt like a pop song lyric you can't shake off. I'm not even sure who said it, but it hit, right in the chest, like an unexpected ice cube tossed in a drink you thought was warm cider. Unsettling but neat.

You should watch it if you’re into pondering the eternal question of being human or just wanna see people act out like Sims in a hovercar era, straddling the line between young and... younger? Also, when did they stop serving real butter on popcorn? It’s all ghastly golden oil now, kills me!

Here's a random thing: at some point, it felt like my mind accidentally clicked away and a bit of my old project code popped up. Something like:

```javascript
function neverEndingLoop() {
  let eternity = true;
  do {
    console.log(Immortal socks for sale);
  } while (eternity);
}
```

Agh, sorry, wrong window, I guess! Anyway, Ad Vitam, man. It’s a heck of a ride.
